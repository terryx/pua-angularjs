<h2>Street</h2>
<p>Estimate Action Time : 5 minutes</p>
<p>Street is a busy place, your target is always on move.</p>
<p>Follow her, take 5 minutes of observation. From there on, learn what she likes about.</p>
<p>Sometimes things won't go as we expected, she might just walking all the way. Then
    you have to start bump into her and spark the conversation. Do not walk from behind or directly in front of her.
    Take angle around 45 degree and intersect. This way you won't frighten her.
</p>

<h4>What to talk about ?</h4>
<p>Cold play is most important here. Is unlikely a girl will give you number straight away.</p>
<p>By mean of cold play is make casual conversation and keep it under 5 minutes</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<strong class="label label-info">Soft approach</strong>
<p>"Hi, how are you. Do you know where is .... ?"</p>
<p>"Hi, I'm new here. Can you show me the way to nearest Chinese/Western/Indian restaurant ?"</p>

<br/>
<strong class="label label-warning">Hard carry approach</strong>
<p>Hi, I think you're quite cute. May I have your number please ?</p>

<h4>Advice</h4>
<p>Smile and don't rush.</p>
<p>Quickly end the conversation if she is rushing something. You don't want to piss her off</p>
<p>Don't give too high expectation. Street playing is unlikely to success but is important to
    gain confidence and social skill</p>
