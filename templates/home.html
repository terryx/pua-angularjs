        <h3>Malaysian pick up artist</h3>

        <p>I call myself Shackle, please pardon me for my bad english. I prefer message that is short and straight
            to the point.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of online dating guides and pick up resources but most of them are for western countries
            whereby culture there are
            very different from Malaysia. So I decided to write a short guide based on my personal experience over
            the past 10 years.</p>

        <p>I started to pick up girls or sarge around 2 years ago. The success rate to get a girl friend is about
            1/1000. No jokes, back then
            I suffered a lot of failures and I keep on thinking what's wrong with me.. hell..</p>

        <p>I guess everyone has to been through tough times to learn something new. For over past 2 years I began to
            understand
            girl better, although I'm not saying I'm a pro. </p>

        <p>I have to tell you to forget everything about girl and start to learn again.</p>

        <p>The very first step is to identify yourself. Take your personality, physical appearance and financial
            capability into
            account.</p>

                <h4 class="label label-info">Physical appearance</h4>
                <p>What's make you different from others ? A hot girl usually approach by many guys. The first thing
                    she notice you is your look. </p>

                <p>Go for facial if needed, go to gym and do some exercise on weekly basis. </p>

                <p>Maintain a healthy lifestyle is important to bring out the positive energy within yourself. No
                    girls want to date a creepy guy.</p>

            <div class="span6">
                <h4 class="label label-info">Mindset</h4>

                <p>Take every girl you meet as a lesson. Always remember there is no failure, only lesson.</p>

                <p>Go out and practice, by saying "hi" to random girl. This is to build up your confidence so next
                    time you see a hot chick you won't feel awkward to approach. </p>

                <p>Keep in mind that no girls is too good for you ! Everyone is equal, do not let your own fear
                    to hold you back. Fear is something that not exist but you think it is. Do not let those negative
                    thoughts bind you. </p>

                <p>If you never ask, the answer is always no. If you never act, the outcome is always same.</p>
